# USER CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS
# =============================================================================
# • All lines marked with "# TODO_USER:" indicate settings or code you may need
#   to customize—such as file paths, user info, or test cases.
# • All main user settings are grouped together in a clearly marked block near
#   the top of this script for easy access.
# • In the rare event that you need to edit code elsewhere, it will also be
#   marked with "# TODO_USER:" for quick searching.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TIP: Use your code editor's search feature to find all "TODO_USER" markers.
